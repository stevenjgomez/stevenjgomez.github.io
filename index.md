My name is Steven (he/him), I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Rice University in Houston, TX, where I work in the [Dai Group](https://pdai.phys.rice.edu/) and [Morosan Group](https://morosan.rice.edu/) on projects related to the exploration of functional and quantum materials -- how they are made, and how they behave. My tools of choice are (1) advanced single crystal growth methods, (2) neutron and X-ray scattering techniques, and (3) low-temperature bulk property measurements.
