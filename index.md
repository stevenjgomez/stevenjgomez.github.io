My name is Steven (he/him/his), I'm from Los Angeles, CA and now live in [Goleta, CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goleta,_California).

I obtained my Ph.D. in Materials from the [University of California, Santa Barbara](https://www.materials.ucsb.edu/), where I worked in the [Wilson Group](https://labs.materials.ucsb.edu/wilson/stephen/). I am particularly interested phenomenon of disorder in quantum materials, both intrinsic (_e.g._, from frustration effects) and extrinsic (_e.g._, from defects). Specifically, I work on innovating new scattering analysis techniques and cutting-edge synthesis methods in an effort to shed light on how disorder plays a role in realizing (or competing with) interesting quantum ground states.

Prior to arriving at UCSB, I completed my B.S. in Chemical Engineering at [UCLA](https://samueli.ucla.edu/), where I concurrently interned for several years in the [Advanced Thermoelectric Materials Group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47UotH8-9VU) at NASA's [Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/). During that time, I also interned briefly in the alkylation plant at the [Chevron El Segundo Refinery](https://elsegundo.chevron.com/) and in the [Kauzlarich Lab](https://chemistry.ucdavis.edu/people/susan-kauzlarich) at [UC Davis](https://chemistry.ucdavis.edu/). After graduating, I worked for a few months in the Materials Engineering, Test, & Evaluation Group at JPL and then interned briefly in the [Thin Film Material Science and Processing Group](https://www.nrel.gov/materials-science/thin-film.html) at the [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov/index.html).
