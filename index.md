My name is Steven (he/him/his), I'm from Los Angeles, CA and now live in [Goleta, CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goleta,_California).

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Materials as an NSF, GEM, and Cota-Robles Fellow at the [University of California, Santa Barbara](https://www.materials.ucsb.edu/), where I work in the [Wilson Group](https://labs.materials.ucsb.edu/wilson/stephen/) on projects related to the discovery, characterization, and optimization of quantum materials. Specifically, I innovate new synthesis techniques to chase after high-quality crystals of interesting compounds. I also utilize cutting-edge analyses of X-ray and neutron scattering data, and enjoy developing useful programming tools to facilitate these analyses.

Prior to arriving at UCSB, I completed my B.S. in Chemical Engineering at [UCLA](https://samueli.ucla.edu/), where I concurrently interned for several years in the [Advanced Thermoelectric Materials Group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47UotH8-9VU) at NASA's [Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/). During that time, I also interned briefly in the alkylation plant at the [Chevron El Segundo Refinery](https://elsegundo.chevron.com/) and in the [Kauzlarich Lab](https://chemistry.ucdavis.edu/people/susan-kauzlarich) at [UC Davis](https://chemistry.ucdavis.edu/). After graduating, I worked for a few months in the Materials Engineering, Test, & Evaluation Group at JPL and then interned briefly in the [Thin Film Material Science and Processing Group](https://www.nrel.gov/materials-science/thin-film.html) at the [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov/index.html).
